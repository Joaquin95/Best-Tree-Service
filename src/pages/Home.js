        <h2>Client Testimonials</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <h3>
            “Carlos and his team showed up on time, walked me through the entire
            process, and had the tree removed within hours. They even cleaned up
            the yard better than it was before. I’ve worked with other tree
            services in the past, but this was by far the most professional
            experience I’ve had.” — Sarah, Plano, Tx
          </h3>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <h3>
            “We had a massive oak leaning dangerously close to our house after a
            storm. I called Best Tree Service DFW and they were out within the
            hour. The crew was calm, confident, and clearly experienced. They
            removed the tree safely I’ve already recommended them to my
            neighbors.” — Issac, Mansfield, Tx
          </h3>
